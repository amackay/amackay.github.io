## Math without mistakes

I like doing mathematics, but I donâ€™t like making mistakes. The most frustrating kind are when you make some tiny error (like replacing a minus with a plus), but don't notice until 30 minutes later, so you have to go back and fix everything that followed from the mistake, or just start over.

I like programming too, and I don't like making programming mistakes either.

Programming and math have a lot in common. TODO

Given the similarities, I find it surprising that there is not more software for checking for math errors. TODO

From my own haphazard research, here are some general categories of software for math, with a focus on checking for mistakes:

Calculators (simple and glorified)

Symbolic manipulation - CAS

Proof assistants
